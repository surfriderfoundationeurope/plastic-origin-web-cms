To install Headless CMS, follow these steps:

### Usage
<!---TODO: It's a code block illustrating common usage that might cover basic choices that may affect usage (for instance, if JavaScript, cover promises/callbacks, ES6). If CLI importable, code block indicating both import functionality and usage (if CLI functionality exists, add CLI subsection).If relevant, point to a runnable file for the usage code.--->

<!--- These are just EXAMPLE: Add run commands and examples you think users will find useful or remove this section if not applicable.  --->

```

<!--- If needed add here any Extra Sections (must have their own titles).Specifically, the Security section should be here if it wasn't important enough to be placed above.-->

### API references
<!---TODO: Describe exported functions and objects. Describe signatures, return types, callbacks, and events. Cover types covered where not obvious. Describe caveats. If using an external API generator (like go-doc, js-doc, or so on), point to an external API.md file. This can be the only item in the section, if present. Add information or remove this section if not applicable. --->

<!--- If an external API file is work in progress and/or you are planning to host API specification in the Swagger documentation, you can use the text below as EXAMPLE (add, duplicate or remove as required): -->
*SOON: To see API specification used by this repository browse to the Swagger documentation (currently not available).*

## Build and Test
